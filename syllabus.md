# Course details

The syllabus information listed here is tentative. Hence, often check the website for announcements etc. 

## Course Description

The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to image processing. The course demonstrates the low and mid-level vision techniques such as filtering in the spatial and frequency domain, image enhancement, edge detection, image segmentation, image compression and their applications. We will not stick with a unique text book, but it is recommended to have the book below in your library,  if you are interested in image processing literature. We will be using Python programming language. The exact version is Python 3.6. 

## Text Book
Rafael C. Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods, “Digital Image Processing” (3rd Edition) Publisher: Pearson, 2008, ISBN 10: 013168728X, ISBN 13: 978-0131687288

This year I am planning to follow the below grading scheme:

## Grading Scheme
- Final (40%)
- Midterm (30%)
- Homeworks+Quizzes+(Attendance opt.) (30%)

I will be keeping track of your attendances. At the end of the semester I will decide whether to include the attendance as a point to your overall grade calculations. But either way it is much reccomended that you follow the course and do not miss any class because there will be po quizes during the semester. And the quiz grades will definetely be included to your grade calculations.

### **Editor Recommendation**

You will need a code editor to write your python scripts. If you're into programming a good code editor is an important component. During years I've used lots of editors on various platforms. Lately, I've been using [VS CODE by Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com){:target="blank"}. 

It is a free tool and can be used on most conventional operating system including Windows, MAC OSX and Linux. It has tons of free plugins for different tasks and it is fully integrated with GitHub. But still you can use any editor you like and feel confortable to work with.
