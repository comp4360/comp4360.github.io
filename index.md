### **LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS**

- Due to a light hacking incident our sumbission system was compromised. Hence I am slightly moidfying the system. Please read [Homework Submission Tutorial](/tutorials/homework-submission-tutorial/){:target="blank"}.
- Even most of the students have already made their submissions, few of you couldn't send after I change the password to secure the account. Moreover, some students have sent the wrong output image. Hence I am extending the submission deadline of Homework 01 to 21.02.2019 23:59:59.
- See Homework 1 below (again).
